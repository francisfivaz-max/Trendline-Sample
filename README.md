# Water Quality Trends â€” Monthly (Secrets-only, v9)

- Filters moved **into the sidebar** under the Refresh button.
- Filters are inside a **collapsible expander** so you can hide them and maximize the chart.
- **Calendar date range** (`st.date_input`) replaces the month slider; filtering now uses Date between start/end.
- Series use non-red colors; only the Target line is red.
